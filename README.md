# Project Title: Financial Insights and Transaction Analysis Dashboard

**Project Description**

This project aims to build a financial insights dashboard using Streamlit for analyzing monthly bank statements. The application allows users to upload transaction files in CSV format, which are then processed, cleaned, and stored in a MariaDB database. The dashboard provides detailed insights into the userâ€™s financial activity, including:

**Data Cleaning & Transformation**

Uploaded bank statements are parsed, with automatic handling of date formatting, transaction categorization, and identification of transaction types (credit/debit).

**Visual Insights**

- Interactive charts displaying spending trends over time.
- Income vs. Expenditure analysis.
- Average spending-to-income ratio to help users understand their financial balance.
- Categorized spending by type (e.g., groceries, utilities, entertainment).

**Summarized Financial Reports**

Users can view a detailed breakdown of monthly spending, top transaction categories, and anomalies (such as high expenditure periods).

**Real-Time Progress**

Users are provided with real-time feedback during data processing, including progress bars and logs.
